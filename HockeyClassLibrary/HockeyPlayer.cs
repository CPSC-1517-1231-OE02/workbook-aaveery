// ^^^ this is not actually necessary - just there to help us organize our namespaces and code
    // when we define a namespace, we are saying that all of the classes belong to this specific namespace

// class is like a blue print to instantiate an instance (the object)

// encapsulation - restricting access to the fields by making users use properties and methods
    // don't want to allow direct access to the fields so we mark the object as private
        // describes the object but not everyone can see
    // properties/methods are public because they are how people are going to be able to interact with the private fields if i want to show that at all.
    // private fields need to be kept in a valid state
        // if it's not private than an external entity could change it, if it's private than they can't
        // if an external entity wanted to change it, then they could use a property/method to change it then we could validate that info before changing the field.
        // public fields would mean that we're stripping away any encapsulation and someone could directly access it

// enums are essentially creating your own data type where you can assign a list of possible valid values that are listed
    // guarantees good valid values because you can only get values from the created list of values

// empty strings are still a string - they are not null
    // use a question mark at the end of string to say that you can have a null value (ex. private string? _birthPlace)
